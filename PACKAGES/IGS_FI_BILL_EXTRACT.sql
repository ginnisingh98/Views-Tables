  --  Procedure billing_extract generates the Bill Number and consolidates
  --  the related Billing information into the extract tables.
  --  o  The input parameters to this process identify the Person and the
  --     Sub Account for which the Billing needs to be done.
  --  o  It also identifies the period, in terms of Cut Off date, for which
  --     the Billing is to be carried out. All Outstanding Charges and any new
  --     Credits against the Sub Account, since the last Bill was generated,
  --     are picked for creating the new Bill.
  --  o  The user specifies the Due Date, Remittance Address and the Bill To
  --     Address as billing information. A Bill Number is generated by the
  --     process and stored as reference information against the Transaction
  --     records (Charges and Credits) which have been identified to be
  --     included in the Bill.
