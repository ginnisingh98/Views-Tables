-- Description:
--   This procedure is the record interface for the delete business process
--   for the specified entity. The role of this process is to delete the
--   row from the HR schema. This process is the main backbone of the del
--   business process. The processing of this procedure is as follows:
--   1) If the p_validate argument has been set to true then a savepoint is
--      issued.
--   2) The controlling validation process delete_validate is then executed
--      which will execute all private and public validation business rule
--      processes.
--   3) The pre_delete business process is then executed which enables any
--      logic to be processed before the delete dml process is executed.
--   4) The delete_dml process will physical perform the delete dml for the
--      specified row.
--   5) The post_delete business process is then executed which enables any
--      logic to be processed after the delete dml process.
--   6) If the p_validate argument has been set to true an exception is raised
--      which is handled and processed by performing a rollback to the
--      savepoint which was issued at the beginning of the del process.
--
-- Pre Conditions:
--   The main arguments to the business process have to be in the record
--   format.
--
-- In Arguments:
--   p_validate
--     Determines if the business process is to be validated. Setting this
--     boolean value to true will invoke the process to be validated. The
--     default is false. The validation is controlled by a savepoint and
--     rollback mechanism. The savepoint is issued at the beginning of the
--     business process and is rollbacked at the end of the business process
--     when all the processing has been completed. The rollback is controlled
--     by raising and handling the exception hr_api.validate_enabled. We use
--     the exception because, by raising the exception with the business
--     process, we can exit successfully without having any of the 'OUT'
--     arguments being set.
--
-- Post Success:
--   The specified row will be fully validated and deleted for the specified
--   entity without being committed. If the p_validate argument has been set
--   to true then all the work will be rolled back.
--
-- Post Failure:
--   If an error has occurred, an error message will be supplied with the work
--   rolled back.
--
-- Developer Implementation Notes:
--   None.
--
-- Access Status:
--   Public.

-- Description:
--   This procedure is the attribute interface for the delete business
--   process for the specified entity and is the outermost layer. The role
--   of this process is to validate and delete the specified row from the
--   HR schema. The processing of this procedure is as follows:
--   1) The attributes are converted into a local record structure by
--      explicitly coding the attribute arguments into the g_rec_type
--      datatype.
--   2) After the conversion has taken place, the corresponding record del
--      interface business process is executed.
--
-- Pre Conditions:
--
-- In Arguments:
--   p_validate
--     Determines if the business process is to be validated. Setting this
--     Boolean value to true will invoke the process to be validated.
--     The default is false.
--
-- Post Success:
--   The specified row will be fully validated and deleted for the specified
--   entity without being committed (or rollbacked depending on the
--   p_validate status).
--
-- Post Failure:
--   If an error has occurred, an error message will be supplied with the work
--   rolled back.
--
-- Developer Implementation Notes:
--   The attrbute in arguments should be modified as to the business process
--   requirements.
--
-- Access Status:
--   Public.
